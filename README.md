# GO2SNOW - Milestone Project 1 

 ### View the live project [here.](https://elerel.github.io/ms1-go2snow/)

The aim of this project was to create a user-friendly website based on a ski holiday travel company. Having some years in the travel-industry, one thing heard over the years is  that booking a ski-holiday can be a daunting experience for first timers: I wanted to create a website that avoids that, without the fuss and overabundance of options and instead, let the user gather some inspiration with the end result having an exciting ski-holiday booked.

## Overview

There is no doubt that a user has many options to choose from when booking a holiday online. While there are many travel operator websites out there, and the aim of GO2SNOW was really all about creating a platform that keeps the visitor interested, wanting to find out more. 
We are often inundated with information when we visit various websites and this can disuade the user from meeting the business goals of the company. I wanted to avoid this by creating a clear and easy-to-use website that invites the user in and inspires them into booking a ski holiday.
 
## Description 

It is a specialist travel company website that is intended to be accessible on all devices. My aim in this project was to avoid the over-infomative appearance, to create a positive user-experience and boost the company's image and business goals.

## UX- Strategy

This travel website is aimed to attract all demographics with a keen interest in visiting Canada, the busy parent who is looking to book their annual family ski holiday; a tour group or school/university group planning a ski trip, plus a young, adventurous traveller that is looking for a different style of holiday.  

**Business Goals**

- To gain an increase in website user activity, online enquiries and direct contact with the company

- To provide a professional, clear and easy to navigate website for any type of traveler, be it
first time user as well

- Establish an online presence with the end result as appearing as one of the first options for ski holiday specialists in Ireland/UK in your browser search

**User Stories**

#### As a First Time User:

> “Due to Covid-19 and the unfortunate experiences had with other travel companies, I want to know my money is safe and I have options booking with a travel agent." 

> “As a busy parent, I want to find inspiration/plan a family ski holiday, a one-stop shop for all”

> “As a first-time user and want to be able to navigate easily throughout the website with access to
the information I need”

> “I want to easily find a contact/enquiry form to submit in relation to certain ski packages available”

> "I would like to find packages available with a company who are bonded and ATOL protected”

#### As a Regular User: 

> "Price and reivews are a big factor for me, so as long as the company is well-established and well-reviewed I will return." 

> "To avail of the return client discounts available!" 

> “As a regular user, I want to see if their product has expanded, i.e. new resorts they cover by
country/territory/province etc.” 


## Scope

I wanted to create a website with an MVP (Minimal VIable Product) process in the overall design of my website which:

> - Creates a clear and practical website without overloading the user and provides information on what the business is about 
> -	Fits in with the level of my abilities
> -	Include relevant and inspiring imagery and holiday package deals
> -	Shows assurance to the user with use of a confident company slogan and use of testimonials
> -	Meets the overall needs of the user and business owner, contact details & forms etc.


## Structure

I decided to separate the website into three sections- the home page, offers and deals page and resorts page. The navbar (fixed) and footer allow the user to easily find ways to get in touch and each page is to show a consistency throughout. Each page is designed to provide practical information, with inspiring images and content enough to enable the user to know what the company provides. 

## Skeleton

The website is divided into the three sections and although the wireframes do not exactly match my final project, i.e. the name change from "Snowest" to "GO2SNOW" which I found to be a more catchy, more iconic name to the brand are just some of the few changes I made. I added further enhancements by implementing further imagery, removing the carousel feature on the offers and deals page and creating modal contact forms instead of a separate contact-us page.

## Surface

I wanted to stick with the theme of mountain resorts by using colours associated with ski resorts, i.e. the colours of runs (blue-medium, green-easy etc) and using relevant imagery to initiate the user into thinking and imagining their ski-break.

### Images
- Each of the images were carefully selected to depict the scene and feel of the destinations whilst providing a sense of adventure and excitement.

### Colours
- I wanted this to play an important role of the surface by using colours associated with outdoor adventure and winter. As the website is a Canada desintation travel website, I introduced another colour into the scheme keeping with the Canadian theme, #c5423b 
- The main colour throughout is a darker shade of blue, #2f4656, which is used on all pages.
- I found a useful colour palette to work from with [Color-Hex](https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/64068)
![image](https://res.cloudinary.com/elerel/image/upload/v1605616507/colour-palette_a3ragq.png)

### Typography
- I used Google Fonts to explore different fonts I could use with my website and decided on "Montserrat" and "Sans-Serif" as the back-up font. Montserrat was my choice because of its popular use and modern look and feel.

### Icons
- Font Awesome was the go-to for icons used and they can be seen across all pages such as the navbar-brand, list items, the call-to-action, offers cards and social links.

## Features

#### Navbar
- By creating a fixed-top navbar, I wanted the user to be able to easily navigate through the website whichever page they are on.
- On a mobile or tablet, the navbar is then collapsed to show the toggler or hamburger icon which expands when clicked to display the other pages.
- The user can click on the logo or navbar brand to take the user back to the home-page.

#### Home
- Contains an animated hero-image of a snowboard mid-air and encourages the user to imagine themselves in that Setting.
- Upon entering the site, the user is drawn to a text box over the hero image presenting the company's slogan and opportunity to view the current offers.
- Includes the company's background and ethos, contact information and an alert bar to invite the user to sign up to the company's e-deals/newsletter.

#### Offers & Deals
- Contains 6 cards of the company's latest ski package deals, each with enquire buttons.
- Further below the cards are a couple of testimonials by past clients aimed to reinforce trust in the company and create a positive look.

#### Resorts 
- This page consists of three areas with key information on each of the top-selling resorts the company sells 

#### Footer
- The footer provides a small chunk about who the company is and where they are based, with relevant useful links and contact details available on each page.
 
### Existing Features

As travel websites tend to pack in a lot of information and options available to the user, my website was designed to go with a more practical approach and avoid the info-overloading. I designed it so that it was clear and consistent across all pages and is accessible on all devices.
- Home page: Fixed navbar allowing the user to easily navigate through the site. I created a second "Contact Us" button on the footer so that on mobile views, the user could submit an enquiry.
- Offers and Deals: Instead of using a carousel, for the offers and deals page I used a card-deck (Bootstrap) instead as it was visually more appealing and better formatted on all devices. Each offer includes an enquiry button.
- Contact/Sign Up Forms: each of these forms are included on all pages and allow the user to submit their holiday enquiry or sign up to the company's newsletter/e-deals. To submit, the user must fill out their details or they can close the box.
- Footer: Spacious footer with handy travel-related links, use of back-to-top button to further enhance UX, social media links and contact details 


### Features Left to Implement
- Functionality of forms submitted, beyond the scope of the modules so far but will learn this in future modules.
- More product: I would have enjoyed to expand the destination list as there plentisome but kept it to a single desintation (Canada) for now.
- Call back request button: a feature where a user can leave their phone number and a brief enquiry box so that the agent can contact the client.
- Booking engine: beyond the scope of this project but this would be something I would be very interested in pursuing in future projects.

## Testing

- Forms testing: to ensure the website was functioning as it should, I tested each of the forms on different devices and browsers. This was done by clicking the send button on the Contact and Sign Up modal without any text in inputs to make sure it resulted with the desired response of 'Please fill out this field'.
- Links (Internal & External): Each of the links when clicked have been checked so that the user is directed to the desired location. To better enhance UX, I made sure each link has either a colour change or underline when hovered (with exception of the navbar brand or logo) and included a target attribute so that a new browser window is opened. 
- Testing across various devices: I used BrowserStack for this, in addition to feedback from my friends and peers.

- Ensured the website was also responsive on all pages through [Google Mobile Friendly Test](https://search.google.com/test/mobile-friendly?utm_source=gws&utm_medium=onebox&utm_campaign=suit)

#### Project Bugs and Solutions

1. Corrected the navbar toggler, as it was shifting to the right of the navbar once clicked. To over-come this, I did a search and found the helpful as ever Stackover flow page: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50046119/bootstrap-navbar-toggle-button-moving-left-when-clicked that offered a solution- to add a margin: 0 auto to the navbar-toggler class and that set the button in place.
2. The position of the Navbar toggler once on a small device (or screen size: max-width 580px), seemed to be centred a bit more on the navabr than I had liked- to overcome this, I added "mr-2" and this moved the toggler/hamburger icon more over to the right of the navbar.
3. The "Close" button in enquiry and sign up forms- once "close" is clicked, it prompt the "required" field in the forms which would annoy a user. To over come this, I found through stackoverflow (https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33477930/close-bootstrap-modal-on-form-submit) to add in the data dismiss attribute which will close the modal.
4. The image resolution on the Resorts PAge needed fixing as they appeared to have a compressed and untidy look- to fix this, I added object-fit:cover to the class and these seemed resolve the image appearance.
5. On the resorts page again, when the viewport has a reduced width to below 378px, the card heading was overflowing thus causing layout issues. 
6. Arriving on the Offers and Deals page, the hero image took some time to load which indicated that the size of the image was to large and causing this process delay. The size of the downloaded image was over 3600kb so I switched it for another image instead.
7. I found that the two background images on both the Resorts and Offers pages with captions were inconsistent in appearance- the caption "Resorts We Love" was appearing higher up on the image than the caption on the offers page. I added "margin-top:60px" which fixed the issue.
8. On a tablet view, the navbar looked untidy with the contact button and phone number still appearing: ![Image](https://res.cloudinary.com/elerel/image/upload/v1605737463/contactdeets_vg2j6z.jpg)
 I added d-none d-lg-block d-xl-none so that it could only be visible on large devices.
9. The alert bar was also appearing untidy on tablet view so created a media query so the content could fit in with out overlapping on the page.

#### Outstanding bugs 

#### Testing User Stories

1. New User Stories:

“Due to Covid-19 and the unfortunate experiences had with other travel companies, I want to know my money is safe and I have options booking with a travel agent." 
*As the user enters the site, the caption or company slogan “Travel with peace of mind…” is placed to reassure the user and ensure they are company a user can trust. “Flexible options” is also mentioned to show that the company is sensitive to the users’ needs and are complicit with Covid-19 travel regulations.*

“As a busy parent, I want to find inspiration/plan a family ski holiday, a one-stop shop for all” *Go2Snow is a package holiday travel company who is able to book all components of the user’s holiday which would include flights, accommodation, transfers plus lift passes and rental packages.*

“As a first-time user and want to be able to navigate easily throughout the website with access to the information I need” *A clear and fixed navbar on each of the pages allows the user to easily navigate to other pages in the website. There are also links to useful information that would be relevant to the users’ needs.*

“I want to easily find a contact/enquiry form to submit in relation to certain ski packages available” *There is a contact form available on every page in the website, including multiple enquiry buttons on each of the offers (offers page) and featured once again on the footer of each page.*

"I would like to find packages available with a company who are bonded and ATOL protected” *Especially in these uncertain times, users need to know they are booking with a company they can trust and are stable in today’s current climate. The promise to the user is featured in the text-box in the hero image upon entering the site.*

2. Regular User Stories:

"Price and reivews are a big factor for me, so as long as the company is well-established and well-reviewed I will return." *By creating a page solely for latest travel deals and offers, the regular user would know where to go to find these, as well as creating a link over the hero image. The offers and deals page also provides recent testimonials and a further enhancement to the page would be to include Feefo or TrustPilot reviews to the page.*

"To avail of the return client discounts available!" *The client can sign up by submitting their contact details to the company’s latest e-blast for exclusive offers.*

“As a regular user, I want to see if their product has expanded, i.e. new resorts they cover by
country/territory/province etc” *The website is intended to show current offers and deals and is updated on a regular basis and in addition the user can be notified by any product change or update by submitting their details on the sign up form.*


## Deployment

- Gitpod, a cloud-based version control software or IDE was used to write all code for this project.
- It was then pushed or saved in the terminal to Github where it is stored in a [repository](https://github.com/elerel/ms1-go2snow/)
- Under "Settings", I scrolled down to Github Pages and selected "Master Branch" under source, to where the page was automated.
- Once this was selected, the project was pushed to Github pages and the URL is then displayed
- To access the code, it can be run locally by either selecting "clone" which provides an URL one can use on their local machine or "download" which is where one can download the zip file on to their machine.
