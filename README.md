# GO2SNOW - Milestone Project 1 

The aim of this project was to create a user-friendly website based on a ski holiday travel company. Having some years in the travel-industry, one thing heard over the years is  that booking a ski-holiday can be a daunting experience for first timers: I wanted to create a website that avoids that, without the fuss and overabundance of options and instead, let the user gather some inspiration with the end result having an exciting ski-holiday booked.

## Overview

There are many travel operator websites out there, and the aim of GO2SNOW was really all about creating a platform that keeps the visitor interested, wanting to find out more. 
We are often inundated with information when we visit various websites and this can disuade the user from meeting the business goals of the company. I wanted to avoid this by creating a clear and easy-to-use website that invites the user in and inspires them into booking a ski holiday.
 
## Description 

It is a specialist travel company website that is intended to be accessible on all devices. My aim in this project was to avoid the over-infomative appearance, to create a positive user-experience and boost the company's image and business goals.

## UX- Strategy

My travel website is aimed to attract a number of various demographics, the busy parent who is looking to book their annual family ski holiday; a tour group or school/university group planning a ski trip, plus a young, adventurous traveller that is looking for a different style of holiday.  

**Business Goals**

> - To gain an increase in website user activity, online enquiries and direct contact with the company

> - To provide a professional, clear and easy to navigate website for any type of traveler, be it
first time user as well

> - Improve website SEO and appear as one of the first options for ski holiday specialists in Ireland/UK in your browser search

**User Stories**

#### As a First Time User:

> _“Due to Covid-19 and the unfortunate experiences had with other travel companies, I want to know my money is safe and I have options booking with a travel agent." 

> _“As a busy parent, I want to find inspiration/plan a family ski holiday, a one-stop shop for all”

> _“As a first-time user and want to be able to navigate easily throughout the website with access to
the information I need”

> _“I want to easily find a contact/enquiry form to submit in relation to certain ski packages available”

> _"I would like to find packages available with a company who are bonded and ATOL protected”

#### As a Regular User: 

>  _"Price and reivews are a big factor for me, so as long as the company is well-established and well-reviewed I will return"

>  _"To avail of the return client discounts available!"

>  _"To book with a comapny I know and trust, ease of booking process and usually deal with the same agent each time"

>  _“As a regular user, I want to see if their product has expanded, i.e. new resorts they cover by
country/territory/province etc”

## Scope

I wanted to create a website with an MVP (Minimal VIable Product) process in the overall design of my website which:

>	Creates a clear and practical website without overloading the user and provides information on what the business is about 
>	Fits in with the level of my abilities
>	Include relevant and inspiring imagery and holiday package deals
>	Shows assurance to the user with use of a confident company slogan and use of testimonials
>	Meets the overall needs of the user and business owner, contact details & forms etc.


## Structure

I decided to separate the website into three sections- the home page, offers and deals page and resorts page. The navbar (fixed) and footer allow the user to easily find ways to get in touch and each page is to show a consistency throughout. Each page is designed to provide practical information, with inspiring images and content enough to enable the user to know what the company provides. 

## Skeleton

The website is divided into the three sections and although the wireframes do not exactly match my final project, i.e. the name change from "Snowest" to "GO2SNOW" which I found to be a more catchy, more iconic name to the brand are just some of the few changes I made. I added further enhancements by implementing further imagery, removing the carousel feature on the offers and deals page and creating modal contact forms instead of a separate contact-us page.

- Landing Page: <a href="assets/docs/wireframes/landing-pg.pdf" target="_blank" >Home</a>

- Offers & Deals Page: <a href="assets/docs/wireframes/offers-pg.pdf" target="_blank" >Offers</a>

- Resorts Page: <a href="assets/docs/wireframes/resorts-pg.pdf" target="_blank" >Resorts</a>

- Contact Page: <a href="assets/docs/wireframes/contact-pg.pdf" target="_blank" >Contact</a>

## Surface

I wanted to stick with the theme of mountain resorts by using colours associated with ski resorts, i.e. the colours of runs (blue-medium, green-easy etc) and using relevant imagery to initiate the user into thinking and imagining their ski-break.

### Images
- Each of the images were carefully selected to depict the scene and feel of the destinations whilst providing a sense of adventure and excitement.

### Colours
- I wanted this to play an important role of the surface by using colours associated with outdoor adventure and winter. As the website is a Canada desintation travel website, I introduced another colour into the scheme keeping with the Canadian theme, #c5423b 
- The main colour throughout is a darker shade of blue, #2f4656, which is used on all pages.
- I found a useful colour palette to work from with color-hex :(https://www.color-hex.com/color-palette/64068)

### Typography
-I used Google Fonts to explore different fonts I could use with my website and decided on "Montserrat" and "Sans-Serif" as the back-up font. Montserrat was my choice because of its popular use and modern look and feel.

### Icons
- Font Awesome was the go-to for icons used and they can be seen across all pages such as the navbar-brand, the call-to-action, offers cards and social links.

## Features

In this section, you should go over the different parts of your project, and describe each in a sentence or so.
 
### Existing Features
- Feature 1 - allows users X to achieve Y, by having them fill out Z
- ...

For some/all of your features, you may choose to reference the specific project files that implement them, although this is entirely optional.

In addition, you may also use this section to discuss plans for additional features to be implemented in the future:

### Features Left to Implement
- Another feature idea

## Technologies Used

In this section, you should mention all of the languages, frameworks, libraries, and any other tools that you have used to construct this project. For each, provide its name, a link to its official site and a short sentence of why it was used.

- [JQuery](https://jquery.com)
    - The project uses **JQuery** to simplify DOM manipulation.


## Testing

In this section, you need to convince the assessor that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well. Essentially, in this part you will want to go over all of your user stories from the UX section and ensure that they all work as intended, with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

Whenever it is feasible, prefer to automate your tests, and if you've done so, provide a brief explanation of your approach, link to the test file(s) and explain how to run them.

For any scenarios that have not been automated, test the user stories manually and provide as much detail as is relevant. A particularly useful form for describing your testing process is via scenarios, such as:

1. Contact form:
    1. Go to the "Contact Us" page
    2. Try to submit the empty form and verify that an error message about the required fields appears
    3. Try to submit the form with an invalid email address and verify that a relevant error message appears
    4. Try to submit the form with all inputs valid and verify that a success message appears.

In addition, you should mention in this section how your project looks and works on different browsers and screen sizes.

You should also mention in this section any interesting bugs or problems you discovered during your testing, even if you haven't addressed them yet.

If this section grows too long, you may want to split it off into a separate file and link to it from here.

## Deployment

- I used Gitpod, a cloud-based IDE to write all code.
- It was then pushed or saved in the terminal to Github where it is stored in a [repository](https://github.com/elerel/ms1-go2snow/)
- Under "Settings", I scrolled down to Github Pages and selected "Master Branch" under source, to where the page was automated.
- Once this was selected, the project was pushed to Github pages and the URL is then displayed
- To access the code, it can be run locally by either selecting "clone" which provides an URL one can use on their local machine or "download" which is where one can download the zip file on to their machine.

This section should describe the process you went through to deploy the project to a hosting platform (e.g. GitHub Pages or Heroku).

In particular, you should provide all details of the differences between the deployed version and the development version, if any, including:
- Different values for environment variables (Heroku Config Vars)?
- Different configuration files?
- Separate git branch?

In addition, if it is not obvious, you should also describe how to run your code locally.
